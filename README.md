## CutePVP ##

A team based PVP plugin for the minecraft bukkit server

CutePVP is a fun little plugin, designed to be played by 4 teams of players on a pre-made map. Players will be devided into 4 teams on login, teams are dynamic and players can be moved around by users with the CutePVP.mod permission node.

Each team has a base, the pase is a square area surrounding a team spawn location. Within that area enemy teams are not able to attack team members or break/place blocks.

Teams also have a private chat channel, all chat from the standard minecraft chat interface is only sent to their own team, making collaboration effortless, for taunting the other team and alliances a /g is for available 'global' chat.

Wool is also a crucial part of gameplay, each player has their reams color wool locked to the helmet position, wool also has the property that walking on it will damage players of the other team, this can be used in many interesting ways.
